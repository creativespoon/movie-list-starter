First things we did:

In JSON set up scripts
  "scripts": {
    "start": "live-server dist",
    "watch": "webpack -w"

npm run watch
npm install
npm install react
npm install react-dom

problem solving webpack
  npx webpack .
  npm watch



went to .babelrc
- {
  "presets": [
    "@babel/preset-env",
    "@babel/preset-react" //added this
  ]
}



npm start
npm run watch
